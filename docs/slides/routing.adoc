= Routing

* Explain how routers work
* Describe dynamic routing technologies
* Know how to install and configure a router

== Router

* Any piece of hardware or software that forwards packets based on their
  destination IP

== Routing Tables

* Router strips L2 info and dumps L3 packet in a queue
* Router matches an L3 packet to the interface it should go out on according
  to a table

=== Routing Table Example

|===
|Destination LAN/IP |Subnet Mask |Gateway |Interface

|10.12.14.0
|255.255.255.0
|0.0.0.0
|LAN

|76.30.4.0
|255.255.255.0
|0.0.0.0
|WAN

|0.0.0.0
|0.0.0.0
|76.30.4.1
|WAN
|===

* Where would a packet for 10.12.14.26 go?
* How about a packet for 8.8.8.8?

== Metrics

* Routes have costs or metrics associated with them
* In dynamic routing, routers determine their own metrics
* In static routing, we determine the metrics of each route
* What kind of data do you think could be used as a metric?

== Network Address Translation (NAT)

* Hides the IP address of the internal hosts but still allows them to connect
  _through_ the router doing NAT
* NAT is separate from routing, but is ubiquitous at this point

=== How does it look?

=== How does it work?

* Port Address Translation: PAT
* NAT router keeps track of connections and ports. It replaces the source IP
  with the shared IP and uses a different source port for each connection
* Incoming connections require Port Forwarding configured manually or with
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play[UPnP]
* Can also use a pool of IPs with Dynamic or Pooled NAT

== Dynamic Routing

* Setting up a bunch of routers (ie. the Internet) by hand would be tough
* Dynamic routing allows the routers to discover routes and adjust metrics
* Hops are a typical metric, that is how many routers something has to go
  through to get to its destination

=== Common Metrics

* Hop count
* Bandwidth
* Delay
* Cost 

== Distance Vector and Path Vector

* Calculates the total cost to get to a particular network ID and compares it
  to the total cost of all other routes to get there
* Works iteratively to converge on a solution
* Let's step through the textbook example

=== Distance Vector Protocols

* RIPv1
** Oldest
** Updates every 30 seconds
** Big network overloads
* RIPv2
** Adopted 1994
** Supports authentication
** Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) support

== Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

* How the Internet routes packets
* Autonomous Systems (AS) communicate with other AS via BGP
* Internally you can do what you like
* Technically a path vector protocol
* https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/11/bgp-route-hijacking.html[BGP is impressive and terrifying]

== Link State Protocols

* Don't chat about the whole table, just chat about the changes
* Save bandwidth

=== Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

* Converges faster than RIP
* Link State Advertisement packets are sent between all routers
* Every router then knows about the _state_ of the _link_ to all other routers
* Very popular

=== IS-IS

* Not popular, but an alternative
* Supported IPv6 from the start, other than that similar to OSPF

== Configuring a Router

=== Home Network Appliances (all-in-ones)

* Typically configured via a web interface
* You can usually hold down a reset button if you need to reset the admin
  password

=== Enterprise Routers

* The infamous baby blue console cable will give you serial connection to iOS
  (Cisco) where you can change just about anything
* They may have an IP address you can SSH into to manage them (will need the
  password)

=== Typical Workflow

. Set Up the WAN Side
. Set Up the LAN
. Establish Routes
. Configure a Dynamic Protocol
. Document and Back Up!
