= Modern Ethernet

* Describe the varieties of 100-megabit Ethernet
* Discuss copper- and fiber-based Gigabit Ethernet
* Discover and describe Ethernet varieties beyond Gigabit

== 100BaseT

* 100 Mbps
* Baseband (not modulated to a different freq)
* 100 meters between hub/switch and node
* Up to 1024 nodes per hub/switch
* Hybrid star-bus topology: physical star, logical bus
* Cat 5 or better UTP/STP with RJ-45 connectors
* Network equipment supports autonegotiation (PS: get-netadapter)

== 100BaseFX

* 100 Mbps
* Baseband
* 2 km between hub/switch and the node
* Up to 1024 nodes per hub/switch
* Hybrid star-bus topology: physical star, logical bus
* Multimode fiber-optic with ST or SC connectors

== Half-Duplex vs Full-Duplex

* Half-duplex/Simplex is one at a time like a walkie talkie: Do you copy?
* Full-duplex/Duplex is both at the same time like a telephone
* Modern networks have components that support full-duplex

== Gigabit Ethernet

* 802.3ab standard
* 1000BaseT (nobody says this)
* Same old UTP/STP
* Most common today

== 802.3z: 1000BaseX

* 100BaseSX
* 100BaseLX

=== 1000BaseSX

* multimode fiber
* 220 to 500 meters run length
* commonly uses LC connectors
* uses a 850nm LED

=== 1000BaseLX

** long-distance carrier: 5km maybe even up to 70km
** commonly use SC connectors
** uses single-mode lasers

== Mixing media

You can get media converters to go from...

* single-mode fiber to UTP/STP
* multimode fiber to UTP/STP
* Fiber to coax
* SMF to MMF

== Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC)

[.column]
A modular transiever that can be swapped out in your equipment to use different
media.

== Beyond Gigabit Ethernet

* Lots of options, this is still actively developed
* 10 Gb Ethernet: works on fiber OR copper (CAT 6/6a)
* Common for backbone work: slow to the workstation, fast between floors

=== Backbone Infrastructure
