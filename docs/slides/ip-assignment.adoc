= IP Address Assignment

== Static IP Addressing

Each host has a pre-set IP address and subnet mask

Best practices:

. Default gateway gets the first IP address in the network ID
. IP addresses are used in sequential order
. Servers and clients are separate
. Document

=== Static IP Addressing Pros/Cons

* Every OS has the ability to assign a static IP
* Can be easily tested
* It's a pain to grow the network

== Dynamic IP Addressing

* DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* Uses UDP on ports 67 and 68
* DORA: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledgement
* Let's look at some packets

=== Configuring DHCP

* On hosts, it's typically the default
* DHCP Servers need to know IP pools and netmask
** For small networks this is typically done via the web interface on an
   all-in-one device

=== DHCP Relay

* DHCP relies on broadcasts, this option will forward DHCP broadcasts to another
  network
* Think about NJIT, do you want a DHCP server for _every_ subnet?

=== DHCP Reservation

* Some devices need static IPs: security cameras, printers, servers, etc.
* This can be done by having the device specify it's reservation or you could
  use a MAC reservation to give a particular MAC the same IP address.

=== Very special case: proxydhcp

== DHCP Troubleshooting

* Most common problem: No DHCP server
* `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`. Did you get an address?
* Multiple DHCP Servers: failover solution
* Rogue DHCP Server

== Special IP Addresses

* 127.0.0.0/8 - Loopback (127.0.0.1, Docker also uses these)
* 10.0.0.0/8 - Private Class A
* 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (don't see this used often)
* 192.168.0.0/16 - Private Class C

Common problem: "We designed with 192.168.0.0/16 but need to shift to
10.0.0.0/8"
