= Wireless Networking

== Wi-Fi Standards

* Wi-Fi is the most widely adopted wireless networking type
* Covered by 802.11, around since the 1990s
* letters are amendments: 802.11g, 802.11ac etc.

== 802.11

* Hardware: wireless NIC (USB, PCI, etc.)
* Hardware: wireless access point (WAP), usually combo devices but could just
  function at layer 1
* Software: most OSes have wireless setup software
* Software: non-enterprise WAPs usually configured through browser based manager

== Wireless Network Modes

* Ad Hoc: peer-to-peer, decentralized, mesh topology
* IBSS: Independent Basic Service Set
* Infrastructure: WAPs creating a wireless local area network (WLAN)
* BSS: Basic Service Set (one WAP)
* ESS: Extended Service Set (multiple WAPs)

== Range

* Tough to predict
* Largely dependant on devices and environmental factors
* New building? Get a survey _before_ you start installing WAPs

== BSSID, SSID, ESSID

* BSSID: MAC address of the WAP you're connected to. Random for Ad-Hoc.
* SSID: Friendly name that is typically broadcast out by a WAP (NJIT-Secure)
* ESSID: WAPs share the same SSID and make a larger network

== Frequency Usage

* 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz (originally)
* Broadcast Techniques
** direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS): diff freqs same time
** frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS): one freq at a time, hopping
** orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM): modern technique,
   commonly used

== Channels

* 2.4Ghz: 14 channels of 20Mhz each (US only 1-11), some overlap
* 5.0Ghz: 40 channels

== CSMA/CA

* Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
* Listen first, then send
* Wait for acknowledgements
* Back off a random amount if not receiving

== 802.11b

* First widely adopted WiFi
* 2.4Ghz
* DSSS
* 11Mbps
* 300 foot range

== 802.11a

* 5.0Ghz
* OFDM
* 54Mbps
* 150 foot range

== 802.11g

* 2.4Ghz
* OFDM
* 54Mbps
* 300 foot range

== 802.11n

* Multiple In/Multiple Out (MIMO), multiple antennas, beamforming
* 2.4Ghz
* OFDM
* 100Mbps
* 300 foot range

== 802.11ac

* 5Ghz
* OFDM (QAM)
* Up to 1Gbps
* 300 foot range
* Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO)

== Wi-Fi Security

* Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS): press button, get pin. Easy but vulnerable to attack
* MAC filtering
* Authentication (lots of options)

=== 802.11i

* Use Remote Authentication for Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) auth
* Passwords encrypted with Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

=== EAP Options

* EAP-PSK: Pre-shared key
* EAP-TLS: Transport Layer Security to the RADIUS server
* EAP-TTLS: Tunneled TLS (only one certificate)
* EAP-MS-CHAPv2: uses special encrypted password function in TLS tunnel. Very
  common.
* EAP-MD5: Uses MD5 hashes, weak.
* LEAP (lightweight EAP): proprietary Cisco auth
* EAP-FAST: Cisco's latest

=== 802.1X

* Data encryption
* Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP): outdated and cracked
* Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): added an extra layer of security around WEP
* WPA2: still susceptible to attacks with WPA-Personal and WPA2-Personal pass
  phrases. WPA2-Enterprise is best option currently.

== Enterprise WiFi

* Utilizes a WAP controller to push out updates/track usage
* RADIUS for authentication
* VLANs to separate users
* Power over Ethernet (PoE) to power WAPs
* Use those UTP/STP runs!
