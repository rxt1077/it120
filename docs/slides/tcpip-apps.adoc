= TCP/IP Applications

* Describe common Transport and Network layer protocols
* Explain the power of port numbers
* Define common TCP/IP applications such as HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet,
  SSH, e-mail (SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4), and FTP

== Background

* TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IGMP run _on top of_ IP
* Application protocols run _on top of_ those
* Can be connection-oriented or connectionless
* A single communication is called a session

== TCP

* Connection oriented
* Uses the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN ACK, ACK)
* Closes with: <- FIN, ACK ->, FIN ->, <- ACK

== UDP

* User Datagram Protocol
* Connectionless
* Used by DHCP
* Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)

  Transfer Protocol: TFTP]

== ICMP

* Connectionless, port-less
* Sends single packet messages: Host unreachable, request time out
* Used by ping (let's capture some pings)

== IGMP

* Internet Group Management Protocol
* Used to notify routers that you wish to subscribe to receive packets in an
  IGMP group

== Port Numbers

* Different services run on different _well-known port numbers_: 0-1023
* _Registered Ports_ are used by less-common TCP/IP apps: 1024-49151
* _Ephemeral Port Numbers_ are used by clients: 49152-65535
* Let's check out the `netstat -n` command

=== Connection Status

* A socket that is prepared to respond to any IP packets destined for the
  socket's port number is called and _open port_ or _listening port_.
* _Established_ means that connection has been set up

== Application Protocols

=== HTTP

* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
* Requests and responses in text
* Network dev tools in a web browser help in exploring this
* SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) wrap HTTP for HTTPS
* Apache/Nginx most common

=== Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH)

* Provide terminal access to a machine
* Telnet is pretty much dead, SSH is everywhere
* Learn to work at the terminal
* OpenSSH most common
* Let's sign in to AFS

=== E-mail

* A federated collection of applications to transfer mail messages
* Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
* Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)
* Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4)

=== FTP

* File transfer protocol
* Very simple, made around the same time as HTTP
* Requires two-way connections, hence passive mode
