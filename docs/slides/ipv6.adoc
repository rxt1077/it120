= IPv6

* We are out of IPv4 addresses!
* IPv4 routing is a PItB!
* What's the solution? IPv6
* (What happened to IPv5?)

== IPv6 Address Notation

* 128 bits
* 16 bit segments, in hex, separated by colons: `2001:0000:0000:3210:0800:200c:00cf:1234`
* _network prefix_ first 64 bits (used for routing)
* _interface ID_ last 64 bits
* _global routing prefix_ first 48 bits
* _subnet id_ 16 bits after _global routing prefix_

== Compressing IPv6 Addresses

* Drop leading zeros: `2001:0:0:3210:800:200c:cf:1234`
* Use the `::` to represent _a_ group of zeros: `2001::3210:800:200c:cf:1234`
* You can only use the `::` once!

== IPv6 Address Notation (continued)

* Similar to CIDR you use the `/` for specifying a prefix length: `2001::3210:800:200c:cf:1234/64`
* `::1` - the IPv6 loopback address

== Link-Local Address

* Hosts have multiple IPv6 address and _one_ of them is a link-local address
* `fe80::/10` + random bits
* If you don't need an Internet connection, link-local's got your back
* Handles all your local network needs (forget old school configuring static IPs)

== IPv6 Prefix Lengths

* Big ISPs get /48 prefixes
* Those ISPs then use 16 bits for subnetting and give /64 interface IDs to end users
* Link-local also uses a prefix length of /64

== Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast

* A _unicast address_ is a unique address exclusive to that system. Link-local is a
  _unicast address_.
* A _multicast address_ is a set of reserved addresses designed to go only to certain
  systems. `ff02::1` - all nodes, `ff02::2` - all routers,
  `ff02::1:ffxx:xxxx` solicited-node
* A _anycast address_ goes to the closest node that wants to receive that traffic

== Global Unicast Address

* If you want the Internet to be able to talk to you, you need a global address
* You solicit a router (`ff02::2`) and your router gives you the prefix
* You then use 64 random bits for the end
* Now _anyone_ can connect to you
* On the router-side, prefix delegation is (DHCP-PD) is what your router
  typically uses to get the prefix from your ISP

== Aggregation

* At the highest level, IPv4 routes are a major pain. A routing table in a Tier
  1 router may have around 750,000 routes
* IPv6 uses aggregation to say that each router handles a "chunk" of the
  address space

== Using IPv6

* Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
* Neighbor solicitation/advertisement: multicast to all IPv6 capable machines
* Router solicitation/advertisement: routers keep track of prefix changes

== What changes?

* You probably don't need DHCP (although there is DHCPv6)
* You need to be prepared to connect _directly_ to the Internet
* Your DNS queries will change (AAAA instead of A, etc.)
* There are fewer games you have to play with port forwarding, UPnP, etc.
* NAT isn't needed
