= Securing TCP/IP

== Origins

* TCP/IP wasn't designed to be secure, it was just designed to work

== Vocab

[.shrink]
* Encryption: scramble up data so it can't be read but can still be descrambled
* Integrity: data received is the same as data sent
* Nonrepudiation: actors can't deny that they did something
* Authentication: verify the identity of people accessing data
* Authorization: define permissions for an actor and enforce them
* AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

== Encryption

* plaintext/cleartext: unencrypted data (doesn't have to be text)
* cipher: how you encrypt data
* algorithm: mathematical formula that underlies the cipher
* let's talk: substitution (caesar), XOR,

  one time pad (OTP)]

== Symmetric-Key Encryption

* both sides use the same key
* block ciphers: done in chunks
* DES: Data Encryption Standard, old 64-bit block cypher
* stream cipher: one bit at a time
* RC4: Rivest cipher 4, fast free stream cipher, legacy
* AES: Advanced Encryption Standard

== Asymmetric-Key Cryptography

[.shrink]
* For symmetric, how do you get the key across?
* Better solution public/private pairs of keys
* If you have someone's public key, you can encrypt something only they can
  read.
* If you have a private key, you can decrypt things that were sent to you.
* Most use RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman), factoring large primes

== Fun Stuff

* CyberChef (Handy for CTFs): https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
* GPG: https://gnupg.org/, https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html,
  http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/

== Encryption and the OSI Model

[.shrink]
* L1 - No common encryption (exceptions being the bigger WAN tech, like SONET)
* L2 - No common encryption
* L3 - IPsec: software that encrypts the IP packet. A new outer packet
  completely encapsulates and encrypts the inner packet. Example:
  https://www.strongswan.org/. Cisco AnyConnect: Wraps routes using SSL
* L4 - Neither TCP nor UDP offers any encryption methods
* L5, 6, 7 - SSL and TLS are found here, but they don't fit cleanly into the
  OSI model.

== Integrity

* Hash - a one-way function that always gives the same fixed-length result for
  the same input.
* Can be used to verify file integrity: md5sum
* Collisions: when two different inputs result in the same hash
* Can (and should) be used to store passwords
* MD5, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512

[.columns]
== Nonrepudiation: Digital Signatures

[.column]
[.shrink]
* Alice sends Bob an email that proves it's from her
* Alice takes her public key and hashes it to make is smaller
* Alice encrypts the hash using Bob's private key
* Alice attaches that _signature_ to the email
* Bob decrypts the hash of Alice's public key and compares it to the public
  key he has for Alice

== PKI

[.shrink]
* How do you communicate with someone whose key you don't have?
* Certificate: a public key that is _signed_ by a trusted 3rd party
* Certificate Authorities (CA) sign certs and your browser/OS keeps a list of
  trusted CAs.
* You get your certs through a CA (some use domain verification through DNS)
* This can be automated and free: https://letsencrypt.org/
* This setup is called public-key infrastructure (PKI)

== Authentication

* User names and passwords are the most common
* Multifactor authentication (MFA) / two-factor authentication (2FA) is better
** Something you know (password)
** Something you have (key card)
** Something you are (biometrics)
** Somewhere you are (location)
** Something you do (signature)
** Some when you are (time of day)

== Authorization

[.shrink]
* Access control list (ACL): defined list of permissions that specifies what an
  authenticated users may perform on a shared resource.
* Mandatory access control (MAC): security model, everything has a label the
  defines its security level.
* Discretionary access control (DAC): an owner of a resource can assign access
* Role-based access control (RBAC): popular for file sharing, defines a user's
  access to a resource based on the roles the user plays in the network
  environment.

== TCP/IP Security Standards

* Remember: This wasn't designed to be secure!

== USER Auth

[.shrink]
* Most of this comes from the dial up era
* Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): enables two point-to-point devices to connect,
  authenticate with a user name and password, and negotiate the network
  protocol the two devices will use (almost always TCP/IP)
* PPP used Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) or Challenge Handshake
  Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
* PAP is cleartext, CHAP uses hashes
* CHAP updates periodically, MS-CHAPv2 is most commonly used (yes things still
  use dial up)

== AAA

* How do you store the user names/passwords such that _multiple_ services can
  use them to authenticate users?
* Authentication, Authorization, Accounting - need to be provided
* Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS): most popular AAA service
* Still used! It's how you get on NJIT WiFi

== RADIUS in Action

* Popular windows server: Internet Authentication Service (IAS)
* Popular *NIX server: https://freeradius.org/[FreeRADIUS]
* Uses UDP ports 1812, 1813, 1645, 1646

== TACACS+

* Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus
* Cisco developed, stores ACLs for network devices (routers, switches, etc.)
* Follows AAA principles
