= TCP/IP Layers

== Historical/Conceptual

* Players: Microsoft, Apple, Novell, UNIX Devs (AT&T)
* incompatible networks
* needed a network of networks with common protocols
* TCP/IP won

== TCP/IP Protocols

* best defined with the TCP/IP model (Chapter 1)
** Application
** Transport
** Internet
** Link
* TCP/IP is the top three

== Internet layer

* Mostly IP
** IPv4 addresses: dotted decimal notation - 128.235.176.1
** IPv4 addresses: hex - 2001:0:4137:9e76:43e:2599:3f57:fe9a
* Also
** ICMP

=== IP Header

* Version
* Header Length
* Differentiated sercices code point (ToS)
* Time to live (TTL)
* Protocol

== Transport Layer

* Mostly TCP
* TCP creates connections using a three-way handshake
** SYN?
** SYN-ACK!
** ACK!
* Also breaks data into segments
** Uses seq and ack numbers to keep track

=== UDP

* uses datagrams
* does not set up connections
* not reliable, but fast!

== Application Layer

* HTTP
* SMTP
* FTP
* ...
