=== Bus

  network bus {
    Computer1;
    Computer2;

* Ends probably need to be terminated
* One wire is easy to run, but what happens if it breaks?

=== Ring

rectangle c1 as "Computer 1"
rectangle c2 as "Computer 2"
rectangle c3 as "Computer 3"

c1 -- c2
c2 - c3
c3 -- c1

* Still one wire, but if it broke it became an unterminated bus

=== Star

@startuml
rectangle c1 as "Computer 1"
rectangle c2 as "Computer 2"
rectangle c3 as "Computer 3"
rectangle c4 as "Computer 4"
rectangle box as "Central Box"

c2 -down- box

* Tough for network hardware designers
* Very resilient design

=== Meshes in the Real World

* very resilient
* fully meshes are rare, partial meshes are much more common
* typically implemented wirelessly
* Interesting examples

== Cabling

Many cables use copper wrapped in protective sheathing. Copper has a low
resistance making it great for conducting electricity.

[.columns]
=== Coaxial (coax)

[.column]
image::coax.jpg[]

[.column]
[.shrink]
* outer shielding reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI)
* connectors can be BNC or F-Type
* common for TV, cable internet
* Has an RG (Radio Guide) rating: RG-59 (older, thinner), RG-6 (newer, dominant)
* splits and couples easily

=== Twisted Pair

* comes in two types: shielded and unshielded
* has a CAT rating
* cat 6a is probably the most common right now

=== CAT Ratings

[.extra-shrink]
|===

| CAT 3 | 16 MHz | 16 Mbps

| CAT 4 | 20 MHz | 20 Mbps

| CAT 5 | 100 MHz | 100 Mbps

| CAT 5e | 100 MHz | 1 Gbps

| CAT 6 | 250 MHz | 10 Gbps

| CAT 6a | 500 MHz | 10 Gbps

| CAT 7 | 600 MHz | 10+ Gbps

| CAT 7a | 1000 MHz | 40-100 Gbps

| CAT 8 | 2000 MHz | 25-40 Gbps

=== Twisted Pair Jacks

* telephones use RJ-11 jacks
* data uses RJ-45 jacks (technically 8P8C)

[.columns]
=== Fiber Optic

[.column]
image::fiber.jpg[]

[.column]
* uses a glass fiber instead of copper
* glass fiber transmits photons instead of electrons
* can travel long distances
* two-number designator for core and cladding: 62.5/125

=== Fiber Modes

* multimode fiber (MMF): uses LEDs to send light signals. Very common for networking equipment.
* single-mode fiber (SMF): uses lasers and can achieve huge distances and speeds.

[.columns]
=== Fiber Connectors

[.column]
image::fiber-connectors.webp[]

[.column]
* there are lots of connectors, but these are the most common
* fiber is almost always used in pairs.

[.columns]
=== Older Cables

[.column]
image::db9-db25.jpg[]

[.column]
* serial: db-9, max speed 56Kbps
* parallel: meant for printers, db-25, 2Mbps theoretical
