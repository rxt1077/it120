= Ethernet

.Goals
* Define and describe Ethernet
* Explain early Ethernet implementations
* Describe ways to enhance and extend Ethernet networks

== History

* In 1973 Xerox (yes, that Xerox) developed Ethernet based on the bus topology
* Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Intel worked together to make a
  standard that could support 10Mbps
* They gave this standard to IEEE (802.3 committee) making it open and
  fostering its widespread adoption

== Frames

[.shrink]
* Ethernet _frames_ are sent on the _segment_
* Frame components:
** Preamble: 7 bytes of alternative ones and zeroes followed by a _start frame delimiter_
** MAC addresses: _source_ and _destination_
** Type: what is this frame carrying? (IPv4, IPv6...)
** Data: payload
** Pad: minimum size is 64 bytes so packets may need to be padded (not common)
** Frame Check Sequence (FCS): cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to error checking

== Early Standards

* Bus Ethernet
* 10BaseT
** Made use of UTP, required two pair but most people installed four
** TIA/EIA created cabling standards 568A and 568B which tell you how to connect
   the wires
* 10BaseFL
** Supports longer distances by using fiber
** a bit tougher to work with

== From Hubs to Switches

* Bus Ethernet used Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection
  (CSMA/CD)
* Collisions were common, causing retries and slowdowns
* Switches don't have collisions because they _learn_ the MAC addresses
  connected to the ports
* This means each port can have full bandwidth!

== Connecting Segments

* Switches can connect to other switches via most ports (typically auto-sensed)
* When putting multiple segments together, loops can be a big problem

=== Broadcast Storm

=== Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

* Uses bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) frames
* One switch is elected _root_
* Ports are blocked to prevent loops, but still listen for BPDUs
* If a link goes down those ports may be reactivated
