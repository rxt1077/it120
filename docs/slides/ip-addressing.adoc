= IP Addressing

== Ethernet

* Ethernet uses MAC addresses: 04-00-3F-12-B6-45
* IP uses IP addresses: 192.168.32.2
* An Ethernet _frame_ encapsulates an IP _packet_

== ARP

* Address Resolution Protocol
* Who has x, please tell y
* Broadcast to everyone on the segment
* Answers are trusted (sucker)
* Check your ARP cache: `arp -a`

== IP Addresses

* IPv4: 32-bit value (can be written in binary)
* IDs network _and_ host
* typically written in dotted decimal
* 128.235.176.1 - NJIT network (128.235), Host on NJIT network (176.1)
* Check your IP address: `ipconfig /all`

== Network IDs

* Network ID is 202.120.10.0

== Routing

* Each network handles its own traffic (hierarchal)
* Got something for 128.235.0.0 (NJIT)? Send it to NJIT's router.
* Routers keep a routing table to decide where things go
* Check your routing table: `route PRINT`

== Subnet Masks

* Used in routing tables, show you which parts are the Network ID
* Want to match the first 16 bits? 255.255.0.0 or /16
* Want to match the first 8 bits? 255.0.0.0 or /8
* Usually on a byte boundary, but doesn't have to be: 255.192.0.0 is /10

== Class IDs

* Classful addressing was used when we had big blocks
* Class A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255, 16 million hosts
* Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255, 65 thousand hosts
* Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.255, 254 hosts
* Class D: 224:0.0.0 - 239:255.255.255, multicast
* Class E: 240.0.0.0 - 254.255.255.255, experimental

== Multicast

* broadcast: one to everybody
* unicast: one to one
* multicast: one to a particular group
