RIP Taco Bell Seven Layer Burrito

1993 - 2020

== Goals

* Understand why we use models
* Use the OSI seven-layer and TCP/IP models to describe networks

== What is a model?

A simplified representation of the real thing

image::airplane.jpg[]

== What models do we use?

* The TCP/IP model describes how the most common networking stack works 
* The International Organization for Standards (ISO) made the OSI seven-layer
  model *after* TCP/IP was in active use

[.columns]
== OSI

[.column]
* Know both the layer number *and* name
* Common interview question
* Mnemonic: "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

[.column]
* Layer 7 Application
* Layer 6 Presentation
* Layer 5 Session
* Layer 4 Transport
* Layer 3 Network
* Layer 2 Data Link
* Layer 1 Physical

== Layer 1 - Physical

* Network Cabling: typically unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
* Central box: hub or switch you plug in to
* Network interface card (NIC): technically layers 1 and 2, usually placed at layer 2

== Layer 2 - Data Link

Most books place the NIC entirely in Layer 2 (even though it set does set
voltages on cables)

=== NICs

* At layer 2 a NIC breaks data into *frames* which *encapsulate* information
* A Media Access Control (*MAC*) address tells you where a frame is going
* NICs have MACs (you can check yours with ipconfig)

=== Ethernet Frame

|===

| Recipient's MAC address | Sender's MAC Address | Type | Data | FCS 

|===

* Ethernet is the most common wired network technology
* Frame check sequences (FCS) are used to ensure the data is not corrupted in
  transit

=== Hubs/Switches

* A hub broadcast all frames to all devices plugged in to it
* A switch is smart and only gives frames to the port of the device it is
  addressed to
* A special MAC is used to broadcast to everyone FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF

=== NIC LLC vs MAC

* A NIC talks to the operating system (usually via device drivers) via its
  Logical Link Control interface
* A NIC talks to the network via its Media Access Control (MAC) interface
* Even individual components have further layers!

== Layer 3 - Network

* TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.
* They were developed together and are often lumped together
* In layer 3 we will be talking about IP

=== IP

* IP allows you to build a network of networks and it is the basis of the
  internet
* There are simply too many computers to use MAC addresses and "one big segment"
  for everything so we use IP addresses
* A typical IP address looks like this: 128.235.187.44
* IP address are unique (and we've run out of them!)

=== IP Packet

|===

| Destination IP Address | Source IP address | Data

|===

=== IP Packet Inside an Ethernet Frame

[.shrink]
|===

| Recipient's MAC address
| Sender's MAC Address
| Type
| Data
!===

! Destination IP Address ! Source IP Address ! Data

!===
| FCS 

|===

=== How IP packets travel

. You type `ping 8.8.8.8` at the command prompt
. An IP packet is made addressed to `8.8.8.8`
. An Ethernet frame is made containing your IP packet with the destination MAC
  address of your next hop (typically a gateway)
. The frame is pushed to the next hop who replaces the destination MAC with one
  that will get it close and sends it to its next hop
. This continues until you get to the network of `8.8.8.8`

=== IP can travel over anything!

* IP is often sent over Ethernet, but it can also be encapsulated in:
** WiFi
** Amateur Radio Protocols
** Telephone Protocols
** Cable Modem Protocols

== Layer 4 - Transport

* Data is typically too big to fit into a single packet
* At the transport layer the data is broken into *segments* or *datagrams*
* Moving up the layers the transport layer reassembles the *segments*
* *segments* are given unique numbers to help in reassembly

=== Deceptively simple in OSI

At this point, we just get a brief description of what happens, but eventually
we will talk about how and why it happens. The TCP/IP model does this in great
detail.

== Layer 5 - Session

* A typical machine is running multiple services at the same time
* The session layer keeps track of each connection
* You may be browsing the web, watching a Webex, and using Slack at the
  same time
* You can see your sessions by running `netstat -a`

== Layer 6 - Presentation

* Translates data from lower layers into a format usable by the Application
  layer.
* This particular layer can get very messy as many things reach for information
  from multiple layers.
* In a perfect world each layer would _only_ deal with information within its
  layer.

== Layer 7 - Application

* The Application Programming Interface (API) that allows programmers to create
  network-aware applications.
* The user experience typically involves using an application that uses these
  APIs: web browsers, email clients, etc.

== The TCP/IP Model

* Less complex
* Works well for TCP/IP, may lack in other areas
* Very popular
* Your textbook uses the four layer version
* Does not have a standards body associated with it

=== Layers

* Application
* Transport
* Internet
* Link/Network Interface

=== Relationship to OSI

[.shrink]
* OSI -> TCP/IP
* Application -> Application
* Presentation -> Application
* Session -> Application
* Transport -> Transport
* Network -> Internet
* Data Link -> Link
* Physical -> Link

=== Link

* TCP/IP techs do not concern themselves with the electrical signals on the
  line.
* This model is built from frames up.

=== Internet

* IP packets as discussed

=== Transport Layer

* segmentation/reassembly
* connection oriented and connectionless communication
** TCP is connection oriented: reliable but slow
** UDP is connectionless: fast but unreliable
* ports used for different services
* gives a cleared picture of sessions

=== Application

* Methods for an application to initiate, control, and disconnect from a remote
  system

=== What is the TCP/IP model good for?

* It's based on how data actually travels so each layer typically corresponds
  to something that gets added or removed.
* This helps you in troubleshooting where you can capture packets and monitor
  where something is going wrong.

== Troubleshooting With Models

* Work your way through the model and try to confirm that each layer is
  working:
** Is it plugged in?
** Is the NIC working?
** Do they have IP connectivity?
** Is the service running?
