= Advanced Networking Devices

* Describe the features and functions of VPNs
* Define the capabilities and management of managed switches
* Configure and deploy VLANs
* Implement advanced switch features

== Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

* Let's use the Internet to link up our _private_ networks!
* Encrypted tunnels from A -> B where A and B are _endpoints_
* Requires a special setup to make both sides _look_ like they are on the
  same network
* A VPN _tunnel_ is like a virtual cable

=== Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)

* Based on PPP (remember for dialup auth?)
* Uses Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) on a Windows machine
* Most OSes have some sort of PPTP VPN option

=== Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

* Borrowed from PPTP and Cisco L2F
* Endpoint is now a VPN-capabe route: _VPN concentrator_
* Often used for permanent links
* Generally uses IPsec for encryption
* Has host-to-site and site-to-site options
* Supported by most OSes

=== SSL VPNs

* You can run everything through a web portal connected via HTTPS (email,
  files, etc.) 
* The growth of the web app has made this a viable option
* Can also use an SSL tunnel (that's what NJIT does), but you need a special
  client


=== Datagram TLS (DTLS) VPNs

* Uses UDP over TCP for better responsiveness
* Cisco AnyConnect DTLS VPN is a common option

=== Dynamic Multipoint VPN

* Remove central server bottleneck
* Various points can connect directly to each other and DMVPN will coordinate
* Cisco DMVPN is a common solution

=== Alternative VPNs

* SSH
* OpenVPN
* IPsec solutions (Cisco IOS Easy VPN)
* Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with IPsec (can even work with multicast)

== Switch Management

* Managed switches have more features and can be configured
* Connection options: plug into the serial interface, use ssh, use a switches
  web interface

=== Serial Interface

* Requires physical access to the console port
* Typically an RJ45 to USB serial cable (baby blue)


=== SSH

* Requires SSH to be turned on, the switch to have an accessible IP, and the
  password to be configured.
* Can use any SSH client: OpenSSH, Putty, MobaXTerm, etc.

=== Web Interface

* Requires the web interface to be turned on the switch to have an accessible IP,
  and the password to be configured.
* All you need is a web browser

== Virtual LANs (VLANs)

* Enables you to segment a physical network into multiple discreet networks
  without having to add additional hardware
* Use all your ports the way _you_ want to!
* Let's draw some common use cases

=== Trunking

* Transferring VLAN traffic between two or more switches
* _trunk ports_ carry all traffic regardless of VLAN number
* The VLAN designation for a trunk ports is its _native VLAN_

=== Tagging

[.shrink]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q[tags are added to frames to
  determine which VLAN they are part of]
* _access ports_ are regular ports that have been configured as part of a VLAN,
  they tag automatically for clients
* _access ports_ have tags stripped off when _delivering_ traffic
* _trunked ports_ can strip native tags off when delivering traffic
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN_hopping[Improperly configured native VLANs
  can lead to double tagging issues]

=== VLAN Trunking Protocol

* VLAN switches can be a pain to update, VTP allows you to set up multiple
  switches at the same time.

=== InterVLAN Routing

image::intervlan.png[width=50%]

* Can now be done on a routing switch

=== DHCP and VLANs

* DHCP relay (relay agent) will pass DHCP messages across router interfaces
* Lets you use a single DHCP server across multiple VLANs

== Multilayer Switches

* At this point you may have noticed we are mixing L2 and L3 a bunch
* Multilayer switches let you configure whether ports work at L2 or L3
* Very useful for: load balancing, quality of service, port bonding, and
  network protection.

=== Load Balancing

* making a bunch of servers look like a single server
* popular services require a _server cluster_ to meet their needs

=== DNS Load Balancing

* multiple A records
* DNS server cycles A records when providing answers

=== Content Switch

* Examine packets at L7 (application)
* Can help with load balancing, split HTTP and HTTPS traffic
* Can even get/set cookies on client

=== QoS and Traffic Shaping

* Quality of Service: control the bandwidth
* Traffic shaping: control the flow of packets
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket[Let's talk about Token Bucket]

=== Port Bonding

* Putting a bunch of interfaces together to achieve greater speeds and
  redundancy
* AKA: link aggregation, NIC bonding, NIC teaming, port aggregation

=== Network Protection

* intrusion detection system (IDS): application that inspects packets looking
  for active intrusion
* https://www.snort.org/[Snort],
  https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/snort-rules-workshop-part-one/[Basic
  Snort Rules Syntax and Usage]
* intrusion prevention system (IPS): sits in the flow of packets and can _stop_
  attacks

=== Port Mirroring

* Copy data from any or all physical ports on a switch to a single physical port
* local or remote: local you have to plug in to the switch, remote has another
  method of access

=== Proxy Serving

* forward proxy server: acts on behalf of clients, getting and returning
  information
* reverse proxy server: acts on behalf of the servers, can be used for load
  balancing

=== AAA

* _port authentication_: typically done via RADIUS supported by many switches
  most WAPs
* Can be tough to configure, common issues:
** Failing to point the switch to the correct RADIUS/TACAS+ server
** Improperly configuring the correct authentication method for the switch
** Failing to give the switch proper security policies on the server
