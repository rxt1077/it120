= Network Naming

* Analyze and configure early name resolution solutions
* Describe the function and capabilities of DNS

== Background

* IP addresses aren't that easy to remember
* _Name resolution_ uses a simple name to represent a computer
* _Domain Name System (DNS)_ is used by the internet for name resolution
* It's not _just_ DNS, names are resolved in many different ways

== NetBIOS

* Early name resolution solution (still works BTW)
* Computers broadcasted their name at boot
* Chatty, slow, prone to errors
* NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT), used for some things
* `netstat -a -n` look for ports 137, 138, 139, and 445

== hosts

* A simple file that lists an IP and it's name (also still in use)

=== Viewing and editing a hosts file

* Linux: `/etc/hosts`
* Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

== DNS

* Heirarchical, deligates responsibility (too big of a task otherwise)
* Top Level Domains (TLDs): .com, .org, .net, .edu, .gov, .mil, .int (a lot more
  now)
* Top-Level domain servers resolve the root
* Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sets up TLDs

=== Heirarchical name space

* Tree structure representing all parts of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)


=== Name space example: people

image::people.png[]

=== Name space example: files

image::files.png[]

=== Name space example: Private DNS

== Name Servers

* DNS server: A DNS server is a computer running DNS server software (bind,
  dnsmasq, etc.)
* Zone: A zone is a container for a single domain that gets filled with
  records.
* Record: A record is a line in the zone data that maps a FQDN to an IP
  address.

=== Authorative Name Server

* Simple DNS setups have a single authorative serving providing records for
  a whole domain
* You could run multiple small zones on one server (GoDaddy, etc.)
* A busy domain may need more than one server (primaries and secondaries)

=== Hierachy is Key

== DNS Info on Windows and Linux

* Traditionally you can find your DNS server in `/etc/resolv.conf` on a *NIX
  machine
* `ipconfig /all` will show you your DNS server in Windows
* This can be a good troubleshooting step
* Remember, machines may resolve names through other means!
* Let's take a look

== DNS Servers

* Keep track of: forward lookup zones, reverse lookup zones, and cached lookups.
* Cached lookups: FQDNs that have already been resolved (speed things up)
* Servers can be _Authoratative DNS Servers_ or _Cache-only DNS servers_
* Forward lookup zone: Keeps track of IP addresses and FQDNs for computers in a
  domain

== DNS Record Types

[.shrink]
* _A_: Individual hosts in a domain (IPv4 address)
* _SOA_: Start of Authority, defines the primary name server in charge of a
  forward lookup zone.
* _NS_: Primary name server for a domain. There can be multiple.
* _CNAME_: Canonical name, acts like an alias.
* _AAAA_: A records for IPv6
* _MX_: mail exchange, used by SMTP servers to determine where to send mail
* _SRV_: general server record for any type of service
* _TXT_: a freemform record for anything, used by DomainKeys Identified Mail
  (DKIM), Send Policy Framework (SPF), domain verification

== Primary and Secondary Zones

* Typically you have (at least) two zones
* The primary updates from the secondary, making it highly available
* DNS can break a lot of things if it isn't working
* _Reverse lookup zone_ enables a system to determine a FQDN from an IP, uses
  _PTR_ records

== When do you need a DNS server?

* You may not need one for a small internal network, but those machines will
  need at least a caching DNS for internet access
* A big internal network could benefit from an internal DNS
* If you host a domain you will need a public DNS server (most people pay to
  have theirs hosted)
