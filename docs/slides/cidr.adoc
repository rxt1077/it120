= Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and Subnetting

We're out of IPv4 IPs! How can we divy things up more efficiently?

== Subnetting

* taking a single class of IP addresses and chopping it up into multiple smaller
  groups
* Subnetting is usually done by an org while CIDR (which is pretty much
  subnetting) is typically done by an ISP
* You're using CIDR when you dont' stick to the class boundaries: /8, /16, /24
* I'll pretty much always use CIDR

=== Subnet Masks

* by taking bits and adding them to a subnet mask, you can create more subnets
  from your block
* I will be using all binary to start, but eventually moving to mixed
  binary/decimal will let you do this faster

=== Example

[.shrink]
NJIT gives you a block of 128.235.132.0/24 to work with. Make four subnets
that can support at least 60 hosts each.

[.shrink]
* How many bits are needed to represent 64 hosts?
** `2^x - 2 >= hosts`, `2^6 - 2 = 62`, so we'll use 6 bits
* Convert your block to binary: `10000000 11101011 10000100 00000000`
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo[Which bits _can't_ we touch?]
  `[10000000 11101011 10000100] 00000000` the first 24 (in brackets) are NJITs
* Which bits do we need for hosts? `[10000000 11101011 10000100] 00{000000}` the
  last 6 bits (in curly brackets) will be used for our hosts
* What's left for subnets? `[10000000 11101011 10000100] (00){000000}` 2 bits
  (in parens)

=== Example Continued

So the subnets are

* `10000000 11101011 10000100 00000000/26` (128.235.132.0/26)
* `10000000 11101011 10000100 01000000/26` (128.235.132.64/26)
* `10000000 11101011 10000100 10000000/26` (128.235.132.128/26)
* `10000000 11101011 10000100 11000000/26` (128.235.132.192/26)

=== Practice

NJIT gives you a block of 128.235.136.128/25 to work with. Make two subnets
that can support at least 62 hosts each.

== CIDR notation to Subnet Masks

* `/24` means you _mask off_ the first 24 bits for use as a network ID
* to make this a traditional subnet mask, make a binary number where the first
  24 bits are 1s
* `11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000`
* Converting to dotted decimal, thats: `255.255.255.0`

=== Practice

What would the subnet mask for 128.235.192.0/18 be?

== CIDR notation to Broadcast Address

The broadcast address is found by not touching any of the reserved (masked off)
bits, and setting all the other bits to one:

[.shrink]
* What's the broadcast for 128.235.128.0/18?
* `[10000000 11101011 10]{111111 11111111}`
* square brackets are the bits I can't touch, everything else (curly brackets)
  I set to one
* In dotted decimal: 128.235.191.255

=== Practice

What would the broadcast address for 128.235.64.0/19 be?
