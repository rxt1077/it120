= doc-build

This is a quick little ruby environment for building
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents and syncing them with websites.
It is currently used to create slides, books, and exercise documents that are
posted to https://web.njit.edu/~rxt1077/.

== Usage

Your project will need a Gemfile in the same directory as this repo. It should
have all the gems you intend to use:

.Gemfile
[source, ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org' do

'asciidoctor'
'asciidoctor-diagram'
'asciidoctor-epub3'
'asciidoctor-pdf'
'rouge'

end
----

This repo is typically used in the `docs` directory of a project. Which requires
some extra set up:

[source, console]
----
$ git remote add doc-build https://github.com/rxt1077/doc-build.git
$ git fetch doc-build
$ git checkout -b doc-build-branch doc-build/master
$ git checkout master
$ git read-tree --prefix=docs -u doc-build-branch
$ git commit -m "Merged doc-build"
$ git push
----
